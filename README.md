This is my take at drills and exercises from a wonderful book named "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition)" by Bjarne Stroustrup.

All exercises of a chapter are done in form of distinct void functions named according to its number. This is done in order to void files abundance.

To run an exercise, simply uncomment the corresponding function call in main() function.

Exercises from new chapters will be added soon.
